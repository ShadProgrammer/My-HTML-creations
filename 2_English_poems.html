        <article><h3>I do not understand this child<br>
            Though we have lived together now<br>
            In the same house for the years.I know<br>
            Nothing of him, so try to build<br>
            Up a relationship from how<br>
            He was when small.Yet I have killed<br><br>

            The seed I spent or sown it where<br>
            The land of his and none of mine?<br>
            We speak like strangers,ther's no sign<br>
            Of understanding in the air.<br>
            This child is built to my design<br>
            Yet what he loves I cannot share.<br><br>

            Silence surrounds us. I would have <br>
            Him prodigal,returning to<br>
            His father's house,the home he knew,<br>
            Rather than see him make and move<br>
            His world. I would forgive him too,<br>
            Shaping from sorrow a new love.<br><br>

            Father and son,we both must live<br>
            On the same globe and same land,<br>
            He speaks: I cannot understand<br>
            Myself, why anger grows from grief.<br>
            We each put out an empty hand,<br>
            Longing for something to forgive.<br>

            <h2><b><u>Childhood</u></b></h2>
            When did my childhood go?<br>
            Was it the day I ceased to be eleven,<br>
            Was it the time I realised that Hell and Heaven,<br>
            Could not be in Geography,<br>
            And therefore could not be,<br>
            Was that the day!<br><br>
        
            When did my childhood go?<br>
            Was it the time I realised that adults were not<br>
            all they seemed to be,<br>
            They talked of love and preached of love,<br>
            But did not act so lovingly,<br>
            Was that the day!<br><br>
        
            When did my childhood go?<br>
            Was it when I found my mind was really mine,<br>
            To use whichever way I choose,<br>
            Producing thoughts that were not those of other people<br>
            But my own,the mine alone<br>
            Was that the day!<br><br>
        
            Where did my childhood go?<br>
            It went to some forgotten place,<br>
            That's hidden in an infant's face,<br>
            That's all I know.<br><br>
